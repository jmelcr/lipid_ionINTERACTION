Dear referee

This work has been done as an Open Collaboration in the NMRlipids project (\url{nmrlipids.blogspot.fi}). This means that all the scientific contributions are done publicly. Thus all the content (data, tools, manuscript, ideas, etc.) have been and will be publicly available all the time (see also \url{https://github.com/NMRLipids/lipid_ionINTERACTION}).

Since our goal is to make all the content publicly available, we would like to make also the reviewers' comments and responses publicly available. With this letter we are asking permission to make your comments and the related replies publicly available through the NMRlipids project, with the condition that Pysical Chemistry Chemical Physics staff agrees with this. 


Sincerely yours, %\\%[0.4cm]
